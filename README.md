# Low Poly Terrain Generation
Working on implementing terrain generating using a low poly graphical style.
The python script generates the triangles for the terrain and then there is a C program to view it.
# Running
First run `./generate-terrain.py`, then run `make`, and then run `./terrain`.

Will probably be used in a future game I've been thinking about making.
